      <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="body">I am a people-loving person who enjoys building, not only relationships, but websites as well. I've tinkered and toyed with HTML and CSS back in the mid to late 90's, but am now jumping to web programming with both feet- and tons of enthusiasm.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Where am I from?</h2>
      <p class="body">I currently live in Seattle, and thoroughly enjoy it here.  I do see myself as a traveller though.  In my time, I've been from Germany to south Louisiana, to eastern Washington State, and those are just the place I've lived. As for places I'd like to travel to, well, there are really only two places: anywhere and everywhere.</p>

      <h2 class="title">More About Me</h2>
      <h4 class="question">What's important to me?</h4>
      <p class="body">One of the most important things to me is treating others respectfully.  This is also how I would like to be treated myself.  By starting from a place of respect, great things happen to you.</p>
      <h4 class="question">What are some of my hobbies?</h4>
      <p class="body">In addition to learning web languages, I also enjoy learning human languages.  Currently, I enjoy speaking in Esperanto, although I only read at about a third-grade level right now.  I hope to be truly fluent before too long.  Additionally, I am learning the basics of both German and Spanish at this point.</p>
      <h4 class="question">What is my dream job?</h4>
      <p class="body">My dream job would be working with small businesses to develope and maintain their web presence.  Of course, if I won the lottery, "mai thai taste tester" and "sunny beach evaluator" would quickly move to the top spots!</p>
      <h4 class="question">What type of music have I listened to lately?</h4>
      <p class="body">Some of the most recent songs I've listened to come from the Rolling Stones, Beatles, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and more.  I am also a fan of Chopin, Bach, Mozart, and other classical composers.</p>
